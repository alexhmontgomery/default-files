This script was created to create a project folder with all of the necessary files for a front end website development project.

In order to use this script, you must have Atom installed (because that is the text editor that the script will open the created files in)

The script creates the index.html, main.css, and main.js files with all of the default that I prefer to have in my files before beginning a project. The files are linked by the names assigned with the script.

Instructions:
1) Place the script in the directory that you would like to create your project folders in.
2) Run the script from the command terminal (make sure your are in the proper directory) using the following code:
  sh default-files.sh
3) Follow the prompts
